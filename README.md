# 👋 Hi, I’m Soumaya

I’m a student at Holberton School, learning the craft of software development step by step.

I’m still at the beginning of my journey, but I like to understand why code works, not just make it work. I move forward at my own pace, making mistakes, fixing them, and improving project by project.

🧠 What I’m currently learning

Python (object-oriented programming, inheritance, classes)

C (basics, logic, memory)

Linux / command line

Reading, understanding, and fixing existing code

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Languages: Python, C, JavaScript

Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code

📂 About my projects

Most of my repositories come from my Holberton School training. Each project is designed to teach me something specific (logic, rigor, OOP, etc.).

They’re not perfect, but they’re honest and reflect my learning journey.

🌱 Goal

To become a solid full-stack developer, with strong foundations, able to understand the code I write, and continuously learn new things.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my profile 🙂
